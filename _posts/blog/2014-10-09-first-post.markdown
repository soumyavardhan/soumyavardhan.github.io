This is my first post on this blog. This was preceded by a couple of hours worth of setting [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) up. Needless to say, its an amazing tool for HTML/css noobs like me. <!--more-->

This webpage uses the [Solid Layout](https://github.com/st4ple/solid-jekyll/) by [Oliver Stapleton](https://github.com/st4ple/), without which I couldn't dream of setting this page up in such short time. I have just started with github and hope to be able to contribute to various open source projects as well as start my own projects. This website is going to keep track of all the updates on that front, but just in case I get lazy or forget that such a thing even exists, have a look at my github [profile](http://github.com/soumyavardhan).
